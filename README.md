# Udacity Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website

1. Install Python Python 2.7.10
2. Open and run entertainment_center.py on IDLE aka Python shell window
3. Successful code will render multiple instances of Python Class that I have created using data structures to display my favorite movies. You can also expect to find the movie titles, image posters and finally a YouTube link to the movie trailers for all six movies.
4. When you hover over the individual movies, you will see a green highlighting effect. Here, I have changed a CSS style (i.e. background color) in the movie website file fresh_tomatoes.py.

**Note: a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py was provided by Udacity and can be accessed via the following GitHub url https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py**.
