# Udacity Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website
Here I learned to build on my basic python knowledge on classes so far.
###Important key concepts learned: 
* class
* instance
* constructor
* self
* instance variable
* instance method

###Things for class Movie to remember:
* title
* storyline
* poster image
* youtube trailer

### In order for this Movie Trailer to function the following modules must be imported:
* import fresh_tomatoes (a starter code from Udacity essentiallly the front-end code of the website)
  * note it must be downloaded and added to the movie project folder
* import media (which is a folder containing class instances)
  * in this folder you must **import webbrowser** to open the youtube trailer
