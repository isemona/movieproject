# Udacity Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website
Here I learned to build on my basic python knowledge (i.e. classes) so far.
###Important key concepts learned: 
* class
* instance
* constructor
* self
* instance variable
* instance method

###Things for class Movie to remember:
* title
* storyline
* poster image
* youtube trailer

### In order for this Movie Trailer to function the following modules must be imported:
* import fresh_tomatoes (a starter code from Udacity essentiallly the front-end code of the website)
  * note it must be downloaded and added to the movie project folder
* import media (which is a folder containing class instances)
  * in this folder you must **import webbrowser** to open the youtube trailer


**Notes (i.e. Udacity Instructions)
* Install Python
* Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
* Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
* To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.

* Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
